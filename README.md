## Feedback on the Documentation

After following the GitHub Actions Quickstart guide, I submitted feedback through the GitHub documentation interface. Hereâ€™s what I suggested:

> **Feedback:**  
> The guide is very helpful and clear for beginners. However, it would be even more useful if it included additional examples on when to use `${{ github.actor }}` and `${{ github.event_name }}`, as well as screenshots showing where to view workflow results. A troubleshooting section for common errors would also be a great addition.

Two screenshots were taken:

- **FEEDBACK-1.png:** Shows the feedback interface with the rating and written note before submission.
- **FEEDBACK-2.png:** Shows the confirmation screen after submitting the feedback.
